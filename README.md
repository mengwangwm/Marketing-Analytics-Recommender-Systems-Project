# Marketing-Analytics-Recommender-Systems-Project
This project aims to implement recommended system and predict customers' response to personalized promotion.

INTRODUCTION
Pernalonga, a leading supermarket chain of over 400 stores in Lunitunia, sells over 10 thousand
products in over 400 categories. Pernalonga, as our client, wants our team to develop a marketing
campaign to experiment on personalized promotions. Specifically, Colgate-Palmolive is
interested in a promotional campaign to boost the sales of Colgate toothpaste.
EXECUTION SUMMARY
We divide target customers into 5 different groups, then find more than three thousands specific
target customers, and find a way to boost Colgate toothpaste sales by rearranging product
placement. We estimate the final outcome of the campaign would be more than five thousand in
extra sales and an increase in revenue by 10% for Colgate toothpaste.
